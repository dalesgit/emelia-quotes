# Long enough to learn

Our lives are long enough to learn what we need to learn, but not long enough to change anything. 

That is our flaw. Each age must learn everything afresh. Such waste!

Such waste - making all the mistakes once and again, each generation making the same mistakes, fumbling in ignorance and darkness.

This oak was already old when I was born.
Now I am old and soon to die, and this tree grows strong still.

We are small creatures.
Our lives are not long, but long enough to learn.

*Stephen Lawhead
