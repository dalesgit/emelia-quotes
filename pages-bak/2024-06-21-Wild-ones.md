# Wild ones

As the tamed horse\\
still hears the call of her wild brothers\\
and as the farmed goose flaps hopeful wings\\
as his sisters fly overhead,\\
so too, perhaps,\\
the wild ones amongst us\\
are our only hope in calling us back to our true nature.

Wild ones who have not been turned to stone by the far-reaching grasp of the empire and its programme of consumer sedation, the killing of imagination.

Where, my friends, have the wild ones gone?

*Joel McKerrow*


'Come to the edge', He said. They said,\\
'We are afraid'.\\
'Come to the edge', He said. They came.\\
He pushed them, and they flew.

*Guillaume Apollinaire
