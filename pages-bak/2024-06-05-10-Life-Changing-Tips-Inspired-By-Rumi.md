Here are ten life changing tips inspired by quotes from the great Sufi poet, Rumi:

1. Challenge Fear: “Run from what’s comfortable. Forget safety. Live where you fear to live. Destroy your reputation. Be notorious.”
2. Be Bold: “Do not be satisfied with the stories that come before you. Unfold your own myth.”
3. Have Gratitude: “Wear gratitude like a cloak and it will feed every corner of your life.”
4. Take Action: “Why should I stay at the bottom of a well, when a strong rope is in my hand?”
5. Have Faith: “As you start to walk out on the way, the way appears.”
6. Embrace Setbacks: “If you are irritated by every rub, how will you be polished?”
7. Look Inside: “Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it.”
8. Learn From Suffering: “The wound is the place where the Light enters you.”
9. Don’t Be Concerned With What Others Think Of You: “I want to sing like the birds sing, not worrying about who hears or what they think.”
10. Do What You Love: “Let yourself be drawn by the stronger pull of that which you truly love.”

## Welcoming Prayer

*The Welcoming Prayer* (by **Father Thomas Keating**)

Welcome, welcome, welcome.
I welcome everything that comes to me today because I know it’s for my healing.

I welcome all thoughts, feelings, emotions, persons, situations, and conditions.

I let go of my desire for power and control.

I let go of my desire for affection, esteem, approval and pleasure.

I let go of my desire for survival and security.

I let go of my desire to change any situation, condition, person or myself.

I am open to the love and presence of God and God’s action within.
