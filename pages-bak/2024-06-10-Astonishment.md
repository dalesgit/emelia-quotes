## Helen Keller

There is no “safe seat in the audience."' What we are addressing here is the adventure of being alive, the being in the “thick of the scrimmage” at all times. There is no respite from life, no stopping. There is peace and stillness possible only in the heart of the action. Storm and turbulence are daily fare too. There is no security. We are always at risk.
Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure, or nothing.

## Theodore Roethke

“Astonishment is the beginning of philosophy” is an assertion of many philosophers, including Plato, Aristotle, and Heidegger.

## Nikos Kazantzakis

The highest point a man can attain is not knowledge …. but something even greater, more heroic …. Sacred Awe!

## T. S. Eliot

…. You are not here to verify,\\
Instruct yourself, or inform curiosity\\
Or carry report.\\
You are here to kneel\\
Where prayer has been valid. And prayer is more\\
Than an order of words ….

## Eugene Ionesco
Explanation separates us from astonishment, which is the only gateway to the incomprehensible.
