Once you've heard a child cry out to heaven for help, and go unanswered,
nothing's ever the same again.
Nothing.
Even God changes.

But there is a healing hand at work that cannot be deflected from its purpose.
I just can't make sense of it, other than to cry.
Those tears are part of what it is to be a monk.
Out there, in the world, it can be very cold.

It seems to be about luck, good and bad, and the distribution is absurd.
We have to be candles, burning between hope and despair, faith and doubt, life and death, all the opposites.

*William Broderick*

Give me a candle of the Spirit, O God, as I go down into the deeps of my being. Show me the hidden things, the creatures of my dreams, the storehouse of forgotten memories and hurts. Take me down to the spring of my life, and tell me my nature and my name. Give me freedom to grow, so that l may become that self, the seed of which You planted in me at my making.

Out of the depths I cry to You...

*George Appleton
