If you want your dream to be \\
Take your time, go slowly\\
Do few things but do them well\\
Heartfelt work grows purely\\
If you want to live life free \\
Take your time, go slowly\\
Do few things but do them well

Heartfelt work grows purely\\
Day by day, stone by stone \\
Build your secret slowly \\
Day by day, you'll grow too \\
You'll know heaven's glory

If you want to live life free \\
Take your time, go slowly \\
If you want your dream to be \\
Take your time, go slowly

â€œ**Little church**" (*Donovan Leitch*)
