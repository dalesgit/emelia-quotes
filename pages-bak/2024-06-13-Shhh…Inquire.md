## Rainer Maria Rilke

…. the point is to live everything. Live the questions now ….

## Matthew 7:7

## Thomas Mann

## Søren Kierkegaard

By possibility I mean a new listening, or as ee cummings would say, “the ears of my ears awake.”
My soul has lost its potentiality. If I were to wish for anything, I should not wish for wealth and power, but for the passionate sense of the potential, for the eye which, ever young and ardent, sees the possible …. what so fragrant, what so intoxicating, as possibility!

## Ortega y Gasset
