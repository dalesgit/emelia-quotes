“Camerado, I give you my hand!” Our work is to bear each other home, to take care of each other. I personally can think of nothing more wonderful than to be the handmaiden of life, to serve as an instrument of peace on my way home, no matter how many times in a day I may forget to reach out my hand. This work reminds me of my stewardship. In concluding this chapter I give you one of my favorite passages, which speaks of this chapter’s theme:

## Francis’ Prayer

Lord, make me an instrument of your peace,\\
Where there is hatred, let me sow love;\\
Where there is injury, pardon;\\
Where there is doubt, faith;\\
Where there is despair, hope;\\
Where there is darkness, light;\\
Where there is sadness, joy.\\
O Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek To be consoled as to console\\
To he understood as to understand To be loved as to love.\\
For, it is in giving that we receive.\\
It in in pardoning that we are pardoned.\\
and it is in dying that we are born to Eternal Life.

–*Prayer of St. Francis of Assisi*
