## Lao Tze

How do I know about the world? By what is within me.

## Rainer Maria Rilke

Nowhere, Beloved, will world be but within us—Our life passes in transformation.

## Mahatma Gandhi

The immediate service of all human beings is necessary simply because the only way to find Cod is to see him in his creation and to be one with it…. I know that I cannot find him apart from my own humanity.

## Arthur Miller

. . . he’s a human being …. attention must be paid.

## Lao Tze

The movement of the Tao consists in Returning . . -

## As Francis Thompson says in his poem “The Hound of Heaven”:

I fled Him, down the nights and down the days;\\
I fled Him down the arches of the years;\\
I fled Him, down the labyrinthine ways\\
Of my own mind; and in the midst of tears\\
I hid from Him, and under running laughter.\\
Up vistaed hopes I sped;\\
And shot, precipitated,\\
Adown Titanic glooms of chasmed fears,\\
From those strong Feet that followed, followed after.\\
But with unhurrying chase,\\
And unperturbed pace,\\
Deliberate speed, majestic instancy,\\
They beat—and a Voice beat\\
More instant than the Feet—\\
“All things betray thee, who betrayest Me . . . .”
