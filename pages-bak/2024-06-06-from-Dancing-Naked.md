The story of any one woman is always unique particular, private But at the same moment any deep, aching unfolding of the heart and soul of any woman is deeply ordinary. Because it is always in the most ordinary of stories of life and death, love and loss brokenness and courage, confusion and wisdom – that we discover most frequently the regular appearances of the most extraordinary miracles. What is new cracks through the torn fabric of what we cannot bear to let go, the light shines through the cracks of our being well-used the wellspring of our gifts pours out of us when we are knocked off-center and fall. without plan or reason, somehow pulled by the gravity of grace into the absolutely right next thing.

Women who tell the truth know these things. If they are lovers, they learn and share these truths together.

Mary Sullivan’s story is, as she confesses, quite ordinary. It is about love. And loss. lt’s about never walking away but always toward the fear, the sharp edges, the brambles, the sloppiness of intimacy, the ache of truth, the fall into unknowing faith. She shows us courage, despair, learning to pay attention, seedling faith. aid the consequent inevitability of ordinary miracles.

Mary’s journey begins with the aching loss of a beloved friend. But in what follows, she gently challenges us: What is it we take for granted in what we have, in who we become, in what we do, that seduces us into sleep, only to be awakened when we are broken open by the loss of everything?

As she bares her tender wounds. shares unpredictable salvations, and maintains an infectious holy curiosity about it all. Mary Sullivan offers the story of her inner pilgrimage not to lift up her own life but rather a gift, a companion, a kind of gentle nourishment, for ours.

I recommend you read what she has written, breathe it in, and offer whatever gratitude we offer anyone who has walked the dark before us and return with the certain promise of light.
