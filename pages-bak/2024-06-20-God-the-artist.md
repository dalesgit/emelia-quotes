# God the artist

Thou takest the pen - and the lines dance.\\
Thou takest the flute - and the notes shimmer.\\
Thou takest the brush - and the colours sing.\\
So all things have meaning and beauty in that\\ space beyond time where Thou art.\\
How, then, can I hold back anything from Thee?

*Dag Hammarskj√∂ld*

## Trust 

My Lord God,\\
I have no idea where I am going.\\
I do not see the road ahead of me.\\
I cannot know for certain where it will end.\\
Nor do I really know myself,\\
and the fact that I think that I am following Your will does not mean that I am actually doing so.

But I believe that the desire to please You does in fact please You.\\
And I hope that I have that desire in all that I am doing.

And I know that if I do this, You will lead me by the right road although I may know nothing about it.\\
Therefore will I trust You always, though I may seem to be lost and in the shadow of death,
I will not fear, for You are ever with me, and will never leave me to face my perils alone.

*Thomas Merton*
