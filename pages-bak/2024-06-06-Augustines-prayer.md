Breathe in me, O Holy Spirit,\\
that my thoughts may all be holy.\\
Act in me, O Holy Spirit,\\
that my work, too, may be holy.\\
Draw my heart, O Holy Spirit,\\
that I love but what is holy.\\
Strengthen me, O Holy Spirit,\\
to defend all that is holy.\\
Guard me, then, O Holy Spirit,\\
that I always may be holy. Amen.

Saint Augustine states “You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our heart is restless until it rests in you.” It is used in the Roman Office of readings for the Ninth Sunday in Ordinary time with the accompanying biblical reading of *Job 28:1-28*.
