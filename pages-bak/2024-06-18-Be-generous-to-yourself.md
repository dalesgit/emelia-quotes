You need to be generous to yourself in order to receive the love that surrounds you.\\
You can suffer from a desperate hunger to be loved.\\
You can search long years in lonely places, far outside yourself.\\
Yet the whole time, this love is but a few inches away from you.\\
It is at the edge of your soul, but you have been blind to its presence.\\
We must remain attentive in order to be able to receive.

*John O'Donohue*

When a great moment knocks on the door of your life, it is often no louder than the beating of your heart, and it is very easy to miss it.

*Boris Pasternak*
