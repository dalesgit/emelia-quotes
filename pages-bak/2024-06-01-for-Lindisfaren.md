## ST AIDANâ€™S PRAYER FOR THE HOLY ISLAND OF LINDISFARNE

Lord, this bare island,\\
make it a place of peace.\\
Here be the peace\\
of those who do Thy will.\\
Here be the peace\\
of brother serving man.\\
Here be the peace\\
of holy monks obeying.\\
Here be the peace\\
of praise by dark and day.\\
Be this Island Thy Holy Island.\\
I, Lord, Thy servant, Aidan,\\
make this prayer.\\
Be it Thy care.
Amen.

## A Haven

Lord, take this song\\
and fill it with Your presence.\\
Let it bring a word of hope\\
to weary care-full hearts.\\
Take this song\\
and fill it, Lord.\\
Fill it with Yourself.\\
Lord, take my life\\
and fill it with Your praises.\\
Let me speak a word of peace\\
that Jesus brings in me.\\
Take this life\\
and fill it, Lord.\\
Fill it with Yourself.\\
Lord, take this place\\
and fill it\\
with Your blessing.\\
Let it be a haven\\
where the\\
poor in spirit\\
sing.\\
Take this place\\
and fill it, Lord.\\
Fill it with Your praise.
