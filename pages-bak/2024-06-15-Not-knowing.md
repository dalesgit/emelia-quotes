## Lao Tze

Tao is the Tao that can not be spoken …. Listen to it, but you can not hear it! Its name is “Soundless.”

## T. S. Eliot

Quick now, here, now, always—\\
A condition of complete simplicity\\
(Costing not less than everything)

One of the virtues is called “The Four Knows”; the tableau depicts the story of one man attempting to bribe another, saying “. . . . and, no one knows,” to which the other says “Whatever do you mean, no one knows? There are four who know: Heaven knows, Earth knows, You know and I know.”
And although we can not speak the Tao, what we can do is promise our humanity as- godly, thereby including the entirety of our human life as creative and recreateable. Perhaps I can listen you as Self, listen you as the unity of your selves. Perhaps we can stand together …

## Heraclitus
