## Seven times

Seven times a day, as I work upon this hungry farm,I say to Thee,\\
‘Lord, why am I here?\\
What is there here to stir my gifts to growth?\\
What great thing can I do for others - I who am captive to this dreary toil?’\\
And seven times a day Thou answerest,\\
‘I cannot do without thee.\\
Once did My Son live thy life,\\
and by His faithfulness did show My mind,\\
My kindness, and My truth to men.\\
But now He is come to My side, and thou must take His place.’

From ‘*Hebridean Altars*’, **Alistair MacLean**

## Poem

Enrich, Lord, heart,\\
hands, mouth in me\\
with faith, with hope\\
and charity,\\
that I may run, rise,\\
rest in Thee.

*George Herbert*
