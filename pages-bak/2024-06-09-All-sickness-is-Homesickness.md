## Walt Whitman

(To teachers, i.e., practitioners)\\
In You, whoe’er you are, my book perusing,\\
In I myself—in all the World—these ripples flow,\\
All, all, toward the mystic Ocean tending.

## Dick Alien

Our knowledge that we shall not pass this way again –\\
almost unbearable—although it makes\\
each moment precious in itself,\\
strikes even deeper if we come to feel\\
the signs and patterns of the mystical\\
on every tree and bush and turning wheel.

## D- H. Lawrence

As we live, we are transmitters of life. …….. Give, and it shall be given unto you is still the truth about life. …….. It means kindling the life-quality where it was not, even if it’s only in the whiteness of a washed pocket-handkerchief

## Ludwig Wittgenstein

Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is.

## Shug, in Alice Walker’s The Color Purple

One day when I was feeling like a motherless child, which I was, it come to me: that feeling of being part of everything, not separate at all. I knew that if I cut a tree, my arm would bleed. And I laughed and I cried and I run all round the house. I knew just what it was. In fact, when it happen, you can’t miss it.

## Old English Song

*The same paradox of living, the paradox of the mystical, is referred to by T. S. Eliot in “Burnt Norton”*:

The dance along the artery\\
The circulation of the lymph\\
Are figured in the drift of stars …\\
All things come home at eventide,\\
like birds that weary of their roaming.\\
And I will hasten to thy side, …. Homing.
