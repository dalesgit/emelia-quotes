## William Wordsworth

While with an eye made quiet by the power\\
Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,\\
We see into the life of things.

## Martin Heidegger

… I recall a hand resting on another person, in which there is concentrated a contact that remains infinitely remote from any touch, something that may not even be called gesture any longer in the sense in which 1 understand your usage. For this hand is suffused and borne by a cal calling from afar and calling still farther onward because stillness has brought it.

## Lao Tze

To give life, but to claim nothing.

## William Blake

To see a World in a Grain of Sand\\
And a Heaven in a Wild flower,\\
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand,\\
And Eternity in an hour.

## Nikki Giovanni

…. and if ever i touched a life i hope that life
knows that i know that touching was and still is and
always will be the true revolution

## D. H. Lawrence

now here was I, new-awakened, with my hand stretching out and touching the unknown, the real unknown, the unknown unknown.
