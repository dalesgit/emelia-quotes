subtitle: Gathering of quotes for my granddaughter on her high school
graduation 
---

In June of this year, my granddaughter graduated from high school. I couldn't
give her a pocket knife and a dictionary -- that's what my parents gave me on
my graduation. I couldn't because a paper dictionary doesn't make sense in
today's world and my granddaughter may or may not be making a journey that
requires a pocket knife. Her needs may well be very different.

### My story

At this moment there is no other need for me to be part of the story.
