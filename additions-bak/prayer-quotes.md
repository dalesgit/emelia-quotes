# Contemplative Prayer

## Solitude

It is a difficult lesson to learn today, to leave one’s friends and family and deliberately practise the art of solitude for an hour or a day or a week.  For me, the break is most difficult … And yet, once it is done, I find there is a quality to being alone that is incredibly precious.  Life rushes back into the void, richer, more vivid, fuller than before!

*Anne Morrow Lindbergh*

## Contemplative

There is a contemplative in all of us, almost strangled but still alive, who craves quiet enjoyment of the Now, and longs to touch the seamless garment of silence which makes whole.

*Alan P. Tory*

## CARMELITE VOW

Let each stay in or near their own cell meditating, day and night on the law of the Lord, and vigilant in prayer, unless otherwise employed by the Holy Spirit.

## Abba Father

The Cry to God as ‘Father’ in the New Testament is not a calm acknowledgement of a universal truth about God’s abstract fatherhood.  It is the Child’s cry out of a nightmare.  It is the cry of outrage, fear, shrinking away, when faced with the horror of the ‘world’ yet not simply or exclusively protest, but trust as well.  ‘Abba Father’ all things are possible to Thee.

*Rowan Williams*

# Into your hands

## Prayer of Abandonment

Father, I abandon myself into Your hands.  Do with me what You will, whatever You do, I will thank You, I am ready for all, I accept all.  Let only Your will be done in me, as in all Your creatures, and I’ll ask nothing else, my Lord.  Into Your hands I commend my spirit; I give it to You with all the love of my heart, for I love You, Lord, and so need to give myself, to surrender myself into Your hands with a trust beyond all measure, because You are my Father.

*Charles de Foucauld*

## Covenant prayer

*THE METHODIST COVENANT PRAYER*

I am no longer my own, but Thine.  Put me to what Thou wilt, rank me with whom Thou wilt; put me to doing, put me to suffering; let me be employed for Thee or laid aside for Thee; let me be exalted for Thee, or brought low for Thee; let me be full, let me be empty; let me have all things, let me have nothing; I freely and heartily yield all things to Thy pleasure and disposal.  And now, O glorious and blessed God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, Thou art mine, and I am Thine.  So be it.  And the covenant which I have made on earth, let it be ratified in heaven.  Amen.

## A Haven

Lord, take this song
and fill it with Your presence.
Let it bring a word of hope
to weary care-full hearts.
Take this song
and fill it, Lord.
Fill it with Yourself.
Lord, take my life
and fill it with Your praises.
Let me speak a word of peace
that Jesus brings in me.
Take this life
and fill it, Lord.
Fill it with Yourself.
Lord, take this place
and fill it
with Your blessing.
Let it be a haven
where the
poor in spirit
sing.
Take this place
and fill it, Lord.
Fill it with Your praise.

# What great thing can I do

## Seven times

Seven times a day, as I work upon this hungry farm,I say to Thee,
‘Lord, why am I here?
What is there here to stir my gifts to growth?
What great thing can I do for others - I who am captive to this dreary toil?’
And seven times a day Thou answerest,
‘I cannot do without thee.
Once did My Son live thy life,
and by His faithfulness did show My mind,
My kindness, and My truth to men.
But now He is come to My side, and thou must take His place.’

From ‘*Hebridean Altars*’, **Alistair MacLean**

## Poem

Enrich, Lord, heart,
hands, mouth in me
with faith, with hope
and charity,
that I may run, rise,
rest in Thee.

*George Herbert*

# traditional prayer

As the rain hides the stars,
as the autumn mist hides the hills,
happenings of my lot
hide the shining of Thy face from me.
Yet, if I may hold Thy hand
in the darkness,
it is enough;
since I know that,
though I may stumble in my going,
Thou dost not fall.
Alistair Maclean
The Lord is thy keeper,
the Lord is thy shade.
The sun shall not smite thee by day,
nor the moon by night.
The Lord shall preserve thee,
thy soul from all evil;
the Lord shall preserve thee,
thy going and thy coming,
from this time forward,
and even for evermore.

## from Psalm 121

As it was, as it is,
and as it shall be
evermore, God of grace,
God in Trinity!
With the ebb, with the flow,
ever it is so,
God of grace, O Trinity,
with the ebb and flow.

# Make me into your likeness

## Master’s face

No pictured likeness of my Lord
I have;
He carved no record
of His ministry
on wood or stone,
He left no sculptured tomb
nor parchment dim
but trusted for all memory of Him
the heart alone.
Who sees the face but sees in part;
Who reads the spirit which it hides,
sees all;
he needs no more.
Thy life in my life, Lord,
give Thou to me;
and then, in truth,
I may forever see
my Master’s face!
(William Hurd Hillyer)

## Arise my love

Arise, my love, my fair one,
and come away with me.
Arise, my love, my fair one,
and come away with me.
For lo, the winter is passed
and the rain is gone away.
Come away with me,
come away with me.
The flowers appear on the earth,
the time for singing has come,
and the voice of the turtle-dove
is heard in our land.
Come away with me.
The fig-tree puts forth its fruit,
the vines are in blossom,
they put forth their fragrance,
O come away with me.
Arise, my love, my fair one,
come away with me.
Arise, my love, my fair one,
come away with me.
O come away with me,
come away
with me.
(John and Ross Harding)

## Lady Poverty

LADY POVERTY IN THE EYES OF JUNIPER, FRIEND OF FRANCIS, FOOL OF GOD

If I am truly poor, then I am dependent on others for everything, and I feel useless and worthless, and I realize deep within that everything is a gift from the Father. Then in this attitude of complete dependence, I become useful again, for then I am empty of selfishness and I am free to be God’s instrument instead of my own. In poverty I begin to value everything rightly again. I see how little really matters, and I see that only that which glorifies God is of value.

I write these words in pain, Lady Poverty, for I have wept bitter tears because I was poor and had to beg from others, and I felt like a burden to people and to God … And I have grown weary of Christ’s words not to worry about tomorrow. But in His grace I have surrendered to God’s sovereignty and providence, and it has made me free …

Lady Poverty, I love you. You, my Lady, take all the sting from being poor. In your embrace I am rich indeed, for I have someone to love. I have you. Perhaps, my Lady, that is why I keep submitting, surrendering my desire to control my life, my need to provide for the future. You have stolen my heart and made me happy, and your love makes up for all the pain that loving you involves … and we know it is all worthwhile because when we look into your eyes, we see Christ Himself.

(Murray Bodo)

## L’Abri

But in addition to these conversations and discussions, something else was happening. People were finding it hard to ‘shake off’ what they were living through.
They were there while we were praying for things that they later found had been given …
They were being given (not by us, but by God’s answers to prayers) a demonstration that God exists …
It was a combination which could never be ‘planned’ or ‘put on’ as an exhibit … it had to be real.
… a completely new work … would never have been possible if we had not been uprooted completely in every way, and if in that uprooting we had not decided to pray for God’s solution and leading every step of the path as it wound through unknown territory.

We also prayed that if it grew, God would send us the workers of His choice, rather than our trying to advertise or get people to help us … So not to advertise, but simply to pray that God will send those of His choice, and keep others away, is a different way of doing things.

We don’t say everyone ought to work this way, we simply say we feel we were led by God to do this as a demonstration that He is able to bring the people to a place - even a tiny out-of-the-way place … and only to bring the ones He wants to have there for His purposes.

(Edith Schaeffer)

# Poetry

## O’Donohue

Beannacht (“Blessing”)

On the day when the weight deadens on your shoulders and you stumble, may the clay dance to balance you.
And when your eyes freeze behind the grey window and the ghost of loss gets in to you, may a flock of colours, indigo, red, green, and azure blue come to awaken in you a meadow of delight.
When the canvas frays in the currach of thought and a stain of ocean blackens beneath you, may there come across the waters a path of yellow moonlight to bring you safely home.
May the nourishment of the earth be yours, may the clarity of light be yours, may the fluency of the ocean be yours, may the protection of the ancestors be yours. And so may a slow wind work these words of love around you, an invisible cloak to mind your life.
(John O’Donohue)

# Echoes of Memory

“Have patience with everything unresolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves as if they were locked rooms or books written in a very foreign language. Don’t search for the answers, which could not be given to you now, because you would not be able to live them. And the point is to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps then, someday far in the future, you will gradually, without even noticing it, live your way into the answer.”

(Rainer Maria Rilke, 1903, in Letters to a Young Poet)

## Emily Dickinson

We learned the whole of love,
The alphabet, the words,
A chapter, then the mighty book–
Then revelation closed.
But in each other’s eyes
An ignorance beheld
Diviner than the childhood’s,
And each to each a child.
Attempted to expound
What neither understood.
Alas, that wisdom is so large
And truth so manifold!

# The Journey

## Mary Oliver

The Journey

One day you finally knew what you had to do, and began, though the voices around you kept shouting their bad advice– though the whole house began to tremble and you felt the old tug at your ankles. “Mend my life!” each voice cried. But you didn’t stop. You knew what you had to do, though the wind pried with its stiff fingers at the very foundations, though their melancholy was terrible. It was already late enough, and a wild night, and the road full of fallen branches and stones. But little by little, as you left their voices behind, the stars began to burn through the sheets of clouds, and there was a new voice which you slowly recognized as your own, that kept you company as you strode deeper and deeper into the world, determined to do the only thing you could do– determined to save the only life you could save.

## Rumi

There is a community of the spirit.
Join it, and feel the delight
of walking in the noisy street
and being the noise.
Drink all your passion,
and be a disgrace.
Close both eyes
to see with the other eye.
Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing,
there is a field. I’ll meet you there.
When the soul lies down in that grass,
the world is too full to talk about.
Ideas, language, even the phrase each other
doesn’t make any sense.
The breeze at dawn has secrets to tell you.
Don’t go back to sleep.
You must ask for what you really want.
Don’t go back to sleep.
People are going back and forth across the doorsill
where the two worlds touch.
The door is round and open.
Don’t go back to sleep.

From Essential Rumi
by Coleman Barks

# Examen

## Jesuit Examen

How Can I Pray?

A great way to pray is to look for God’s presence in your life. More than 400 years ago St. Ignatius Loyola encouraged prayer-filled mindfulness by proposing what has been called the Daily Examen. The Examen is a technique of prayerful reflection on the events of the day in order to detect God’s presence and to discern his direction for us. Try this version of St. Ignatius’s prayer.

Become aware of God’s presence. Look back on the events of the day in the company of the Holy Spirit. The day may seem confusing to you—a blur, a jumble, a muddle. Ask God to bring clarity and understanding.

Review the day with gratitude. Gratitude is the foundation of our relationship with God. Walk through your day in the presence of God and note its joys and delights. Focus on the day’s gifts. Look at the work you did, the people you interacted with. What did you receive from these people? What did you give them? Pay attention to small things—the food you ate, the sights you saw, and other seemingly small pleasures. God is in the details.

Pay attention to your emotions. One of St. Ignatius’s great insights was that we detect the presence of the Spirit of God in the movements of our emotions. Reflect on the feelings you experienced during the day. Boredom? Elation? Resentment? Compassion? Anger? Confidence? What is God saying through these feelings?

God will most likely show you some ways that you fell short. Make note of these sins and faults. But look deeply for other implications. Does a feeling of frustration perhaps mean that God wants you consider a new direction in some area of your work? Are you concerned about a friend? Perhaps you should reach out to her in some way.

Choose one feature of the day and pray from it. Ask the Holy Spirit to direct you to something during the day that God thinks is particularly important. It may involve a feeling—positive or negative. It may be a significant encounter with another person or a vivid moment of pleasure or peace. Or it may be something that seems rather insignificant. Look at it. Pray about it. Allow the prayer to arise spontaneously from your heart—whether intercession, praise, repentance, or gratitude.

Look toward tomorrow. Ask God to give you light for tomorrow’s challenges. Pay attention to the feelings that surface as you survey what’s coming up. Are you doubtful? Cheerful? Apprehensive? Full of delighted anticipation? Allow these feelings to turn into prayer. Seek God’s guidance. Ask him for help and understanding. Pray for hope.

St. Ignatius encouraged people to talk to Jesus like a friend. End the Daily Examen with a conversation with Jesus. Ask forgiveness for your sins. Ask for his protection and help. Ask for his wisdom about the questions you have and the problems you face. Do all this in the spirit of gratitude. Your life is a gift, and it is adorned with gifts from God. End the Daily Examen with the Our Father.

# 10 Life Changing Tips Inspired By Rumi

By Robert Piper

Here are ten life changing tips inspired by quotes from the great Sufi poet, Rumi:

1. Challenge Fear: “Run from what’s comfortable. Forget safety. Live where you fear to live. Destroy your reputation. Be notorious.”
2. Be Bold: “Do not be satisfied with the stories that come before you. Unfold your own myth.”
3. Have Gratitude: “Wear gratitude like a cloak and it will feed every corner of your life.”
4. Take Action: “Why should I stay at the bottom of a well, when a strong rope is in my hand?”
5. Have Faith: “As you start to walk out on the way, the way appears.”
6. Embrace Setbacks: “If you are irritated by every rub, how will you be polished?”
7. Look Inside: “Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it.”
8. Learn From Suffering: “The wound is the place where the Light enters you.”
9. Don’t Be Concerned With What Others Think Of You: “I want to sing like the birds sing, not worrying about who hears or what they think.”
10. Do What You Love: “Let yourself be drawn by the stronger pull of that which you truly love.”

## Welcoming Prayer

The Welcoming Prayer (by Father Thomas Keating)

Welcome, welcome, welcome.
I welcome everything that comes to me today
because I know it’s for my healing.
I welcome all thoughts, feelings, emotions, persons,
situations, and conditions.
I let go of my desire for power and control.
I let go of my desire for affection, esteem,
approval and pleasure.
I let go of my desire for survival and security.
I let go of my desire to change any situation,
condition, person or myself.
I open to the love and presence of God and
God’s action within. Am

# from Dancing Naked

The story of any one woman is always unique particular, private But at the same moment any deep, aching unfolding of the heart and soul of any woman is deeply ordinary. Because it is always in the most ordinary of stories of life and death, love and loss brokenness and courage, confusion and wisdom – that we discover most frequently the regular appearances of the most extraordinary miracles. What is new cracks through the torn fabric of what we cannot bear to let go, the light shines through the cracks of our being well-used the wellspring of our gifts pours out of us when we are knocked off-center and fall. without plan or reason, somehow pulled by the gravity of grace into the absolutely right next thing.

Women who tell the truth know these things. If they are lovers, they learn and share these truths together.

Mary Sullivan’s story is, as she confesses, quite ordinary. It is about love. And loss. lt’s about never walking away but always toward the fear, the sharp edges, the brambles, the sloppiness of intimacy, the ache of truth, the fall into unknowing faith. She shows us courage, despair, learning to pay attention, seedling faith. aid the consequent inevitability of ordinary miracles.

Mary’s journey begins with the aching loss of a beloved friend. But in what follows, she gently challenges us: What is it we take for granted in what we have, in who we become, in what we do, that seduces us into sleep, only to be awakened when we are broken open by the loss of everything?

As she bares her tender wounds. shares unpredictable salvations, and maintains an infectious holy curiosity about it all. Mary Sullivan offers the story of her inner pilgrimage not to lift up her own life but rather a gift, a companion, a kind of gentle nourishment, for ours.

I recommend you read what she has written, breathe it in, and offer whatever gratitude we offer anyone who has walked the dark before us and return with the certain promise of light.

Wayne Muller author of Sabbath, How Then Shall We Live and Learning to Pray

# Augustine’s prayer

Breathe in me, O Holy Spirit,
that my thoughts may all be holy.
Act in me, O Holy Spirit,
that my work, too, may be holy.
Draw my heart, O Holy Spirit,
that I love but what is holy.
Strengthen me, O Holy Spirit,
to defend all that is holy.
Guard me, then, O Holy Spirit,
that I always may be holy. Amen.

Saint Augustine states “You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our heart is restless until it rests in you.” It is used in the Roman Office of readings for the Ninth Sunday in Ordinary time with the accompanying biblical reading of Job 28:1-28.

# Source of Wisdom

The Message (MSG) Where Does Wisdom Come From?

^{28:1-11} “We all know how silver seams the rocks,
    we’ve seen the stuff from which gold is refined,
We’re aware of how iron is dug out of the ground
    and copper is smelted from rock.
Miners penetrate the earth’s darkness,
    searching the roots of the mountains for ore,
    digging away in the suffocating darkness.
Far from civilization, far from the traffic,
    they cut a shaft,
    and are lowered into it by ropes.
Earth’s surface is a field for grain,
    but its depths are a forge
Firing sapphires from stones
    and chiseling gold from rocks.
Vultures are blind to its riches,
    hawks never lay eyes on it.
Wild animals are oblivious to it,
    lions don’t know it’s there.
Miners hammer away at the rock,
    they uproot the mountains.
They tunnel through the rock
    and find all kinds of beautiful gems.
They discover the origins of rivers,
    and bring earth’s secrets to light.
^{12-19} “But where, oh where, will they find Wisdom?
    Where does Insight hide?
Mortals don’t have a clue,
    haven’t the slightest idea where to look.
Earth’s depths say, ‘It’s not here’;
    ocean deeps echo, ‘Never heard of it.’
It can’t be bought with the finest gold;
    no amount of silver can get it.
Even famous Ophir gold can’t buy it,
    not even diamonds and sapphires.
Neither gold nor emeralds are comparable;
    extravagant jewelry can’t touch it.
Pearl necklaces and ruby bracelets—why bother?
    None of this is even a down payment on Wisdom!
Pile gold and African diamonds as high as you will,
    they can’t hold a candle to Wisdom.
^{20-22} “So where does Wisdom come from?
    And where does Insight live?
It can’t be found by looking, no matter
    how deep you dig, no matter how high you fly.
If you search through the graveyard and question the dead,
    they say, ‘We’ve only heard rumors of it.’
^{23-28} “God alone knows the way to Wisdom,
    he knows the exact place to find it.
He knows where everything is on earth,
    he sees everything under heaven.
After he commanded the winds to blow
    and measured out the waters,
Arranged for the rain
    and set off explosions of thunder and lightning,
He focused on Wisdom,
    made sure it was all set and tested and ready.
Then he addressed the human race: ‘Here it is!
    Fear-of-the-Lord—that’s Wisdom,
    and Insight means shunning evil.’”
“And man wants to praise you, man who is only a small portion of what you have created and who goes about carrying with him his own mortality, the evidence of his own sin and evidence that you resist the proud …. Yet still man, this small portion of creation, wants to praise you. You stimulate him to take pleasure in praising you, because you have made us for yourself, and our hearts are restless until they find their rest in you.”

# Fall in Love

Attributed to Fr. Pedro Arrupe, SJ (1907–1991)

Nothing is more practical than
finding God, than
falling in Love
in a quite absolute, final way.
What you are in love with,
what seizes your imagination, will affect everything.
It will decide
what will get you out of bed in the morning,
what you do with your evenings,
how you spend your weekends,
what you read, whom you know,
what breaks your heart,
and what amazes you with joy and gratitude.
Fall in Love, stay in love,
and it will decide everything.

## Madonna House

Arise — go! Sell all you possess. Give it directly, personally to the poor. Take up My cross (their cross) and follow Me, going to the poor, being poor, being one with them, one with Me.
Little — be always little! Be simple, poor, childlike.
Preach the Gospel with your life — without compromise! Listen to the Spirit. He will lead you.
Do little things exceedingly well for love of Me.
Love… love… love, never counting the cost.
Go into the marketplace and stay with Me. Pray, fast. Pray always, fast.
Be hidden. Be a light to your neighbour’s feet. Go without fear into the depth of men’s hearts. I shall be with you.
Pray always. I will be your rest.

## Antoine de Saint-Expury

Author of The Little Prince:

“If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up people together to collect wood and don’t assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.”

## Pablo Neruda

“All paths lead to the same goal: to convey to others what we are. And we must pass through solitude and difficulty, isolation and silence, in order to reach forth to the enchanted place where we can dance our clumsy dance and sing our sorrowful song–but in this dance or in this song there are fulfilled the most ancient rites of our conscience in the awareness of being human and of believing in a common destiny.” –Pablo Neruda, 1971
“Poetry is a deep inner calling in man; from it came liturgy, the psalms, and also the content of religions.” –Pablo Neruda, Memoirs, 1974

## Walt Whitman

(To teachers, i.e., practitioners)
In You, whoe’er you are, my book perusing,
In I myself—in all the World—these ripples flow,
All, all, toward the mystic Ocean tending.

## Dick Alien

Our knowledge that we shall not pass this way again –
almost unbearable—although it makes
each moment precious in itself,
strikes even deeper if we come to feel
the signs and patterns of the mystical
on every tree and bush and turning wheel.

## D- H. Lawrence

As we live, we are transmitters of life. …….. Give, and it shall be given unto you is still the truth about life. …….. It means kindling the life-quality where it was not, even if it’s only in the whiteness of a washed pocket-handkerchief

## Ludwig Wittgenstein

Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is.

## Shug, in Alice Walker’s The Color Purple

One day when I was feeling like a motherless child, which I was, it come to me: that feeling of being part of everything, not separate at all. I knew that if I cut a tree, my arm would bleed. And I laughed and I cried and I run all round the house. I knew just what it was. In fact, when it happen, you can’t miss it.

## Old English Song

The same paradox of living, the paradox of the mystical, is referred to by T. S. Eliot in “Burnt Norton”:
The dance along the artery
The circulation of the lymph
Are figured in the drift of stars …
All things come home at eventide,
like birds that weary of their roaming.
And I will hasten to thy side, …. Homing.

# To Be

## Lao Tze, as told by Alan Watts

The story of the Taoist farmer illustrates a way of interpreting the dance of life’s events: The farmer’s horse ran away. That evening the neighbors gathered to commiserate with him since this was such bad-luck. He said, “May be.” The next day the horse returned, but brought with it six wild horses, and the neighbors came exclaiming at his good fortune. He said, “May be.” And then, the following day, his son tried to saddle and ride one of the wild horses, was thrown, and broke his leg. Again the neighbors came to offer their sympathy for his misfortune. He said, “May be.” The day after that, conscription officers came to the village to seize young men tor the army, but because of the broken leg the farmer’s son was rejected. When the neighbors came in to say how fortunately everything had turned out, he said, “May be.”

## Lao Tze

There is no need to run outside
For better seeing,
Nor to peer from a window. Rather abide
At the center of your being ….
Search your heart and see ….
The way to do is to be.

## Octavio Paz

gateway of being: open your being, awaken,
learn then to be, begin to carve your face,
develop your elements, and keep your vision
keen to look at my face, as I at yours,
keen to look full at life right through to death,
faces of sea, of bread, of rock, of fountain,
the spring of origin which will dissolve our faces
in the nameless face, existence without face
the inexpressible presence of presences ….

## Lao Tze

The Tao does nothing, yet nothing is left undone.

## George Steiner

The Greeks called “being” … parousia … The veritable translation would be a set or cluster of significations comprising “homestead, at-homeness, a standing in and by itself, a self-enclosedness, an integral presentness or thereness.” … it is just this ground that we must strive to come home (“homecoming” is, as we shall see, both the process and the goal of authentic being).

19.6 D. H, Lawrence

It is the continuous underbelly of being human. It is the place of the mystic. The practice of being home is being home. Who ever reads me will be in the thick of the scrimmage, and if he doesn’t like it—if he wants a safe seat in the audience— let him read somebody else ….
# Astonishment

20.1 Helen Keller

There is no “safe seat in the audience."' What we are addressing here is the adventure of being alive, the being in the “thick of the scrimmage” at all times. There is no respite from life, no stopping. There is peace and stillness possible only in the heart of the action. Storm and turbulence are daily fare too. There is no security. We are always at risk.
Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure, or nothing.

## Theodore Roethke

“Astonishment is the beginning of philosophy” is an assertion of many philosophers, including Plato, Aristotle, and Heidegger.
Live is a perpetual great astonishment.

## Albert Schweitzer

Late on the third day, at the very moment when, at sunset, we were making our way through a herd of hippopotamuses, there flashed upon my mind, unforeseen and unsought, the phrase, “Reverence for Life,”

## Nikos Kazantzakis

The highest point a man can attain is not knowledge …. but something even greater, more heroic …. Sacred Awe!

## T. S. Eliot

…. You are not here to verify,
Instruct yourself, or inform curiosity
Or carry report.
You are here to kneel
Where prayer has been valid. And prayer is more
Than an order of words ….
20.6 Eugene Ionesco
Explanation separates us from astonishment, which is the only gateway to the incomprehensible.

# A teacher creates worlds

## Benjamin Hoff, The Tao of Pooh

A teacher creates worlds. Each world created is a sacred vessel. As Roethke defines the word, “Teacher: one who carries on her education in public.” She creates by giving voice and giving silence, by speaking words and listening from whence the words come. She can not be teacher-coach-awe-inspirer without giving herself away, without opening to her own astonishing aliveness, without publicly wondering and wandering in her own beginner’s mind.
“Don’t say; create.” These words from Roethke express the promise of one’s life as teacher. Life is awesome, awe-filled. She teaches from awe, and not from her opinions, beliefs, advice. She does whatever will forward the life of the one or ones she is coaching. “Teach as an old fishing guide takes out a beginner.” (Roethke) She lives at the edge of life as a creative act, continuous and evolving, not infrequently terrified of her own godliness; not infrequently enraptured by the joy and fun of it all; always grappling with her own humanity. “When you discard arrogance, complexity, and a few other things that get in the way, sooner or later you will discover that simple, childlike, and mysterious secret known to those of the Uncarved Block: Life is Fun.”

# Home is where

## T. S. Eliot

Home is where we start from . . .

## Robert Frost

“Warren,” she said, “he has come home to die:
You needn’t be afraid he’ll leave you this time.”
“Home,” he mocked gently.
“Yes, what else but home?
It all depends on what you mean by home.
Of course, he’s nothing to us, any more
Than was the hound that came as a stranger to us
Out of the woods, worn out upon the trail.
“Home is the place where, when you have to go there,
They have to take you in.”

# Look within

## Lao Tze

How do I know about the world? By what is within me.

## Rainer Maria Rilke

Nowhere, Beloved, will world be but within us—Our life passes in transformation.

## Mahatma Gandhi

The immediate service of all human beings is necessary simply because the only way to find Cod is to see him in his creation and to be one with it…. I know that I cannot find him apart from my own humanity.

## Arthur Miller

. . . he’s a human being …. attention must be paid.

## Lao Tze

The movement of the Tao consists in Returning . . -

## As Francis Thompson says in his poem “The Hound of Heaven”:

I fled Him, down the nights and down the days;
I fled Him down the arches of the years;
I fled Him, down the labyrinthine ways
Of my own mind; and in the midst of tears
I hid from Him, and under running laughter.
Up vistaed hopes I sped;
And shot, precipitated,
Adown Titanic glooms of chasmed fears,
From those strong Feet that followed, followed after.
But with unhurrying chase,
And unperturbed pace,
Deliberate speed, majestic instancy,
They beat—and a Voice beat
More instant than the Feet—
“All things betray thee, who betrayest Me . . . .”

# House at Pooh Corner

## A. A. Milne, The House at Pooh Corner

“Well,” said Pooh, “we keep looking for Home and not finding it, so I thought that if we looked for this Pit, we’d be sure not to find it, which would be a Good Thing, because then we might find something that we weren’t looking tor, which might be just what we were looking for, really.” “T don’t see much sense in that,” said Rabbit …. “If I walked away from this Pit, and then walked back to it, of course I should find it.” “Well, I thought perhaps you wouldn’t,” said Pooh. “I just thought.” “Try.” said Piglet suddenly. “We’ll wait here for you.” Rabbit gave a laugh to show how silly Piglet was, and walked into the mist. After he had gone a hundred yards, he turned and walked back again -,.. and after Pooh and Piglet had waited twenty minutes for him, Pooh got up. “I just thought,” said Pooh. “Now then, Piglet, let’s go home.” “But, Pooh,” cried Piglet, all excited, “do you know the way?” “No,"said Pooh. “But there are twelve pots of honey in my cupboard, and they’ve been calling to me for hours. I couldn’t hear them properly before, because Rabbit would talk, but if nobody says anything except those twelve pots, I think, Piglet, I shall know where they are calling from. Come on.

## Teilhard de Chardin, speaks in his book, The Heart of Matter.

Our stories are many, as many as we are—although in 0 Pioneers Willa Gather tells us there are probably only two or three human themes and they keep being played out fiercely as though for the first time. At the heart of our matter, our stories give the interpretation of the journey of our lives. At the source of the journey we are home, before making the distinctions being-story-journey-home. It is from there that the wondrous caller to life,

## Look Homeward, Angel, Thomas Wolfe

‘You had need of me in order to grow; and I was waiting for you in order to be made holy- ‘Always you have, without knowing it, desired me; and always I have been drawing you to me …. ‘Are you coming?’
Lines carved on Thomas Wolfe’s gravestone from his own work: The last voyage—the longest, the best

# Things to do
## Excerpt from a letter written by Buckminster Fuller to a ten-year-old:

The things to do are: the things that need doing, that you see need to be done, and that no one else seems to see need to be done. Then you will conceive your own way of doing that which needs to be done—that no one else has told you to do or how to do it. This will bring out the real you that often gets buried inside a character that has acquired a superficial array of behaviors induced or imposed by others on the individual.

Try making experiments of anything you conceive and are intensely interested in. Don’t be disappointed if something doesn’t work. That is what you want to know—the truth about everything—and then the truth about combinations of things. Some combinations have such logic and integrity that they can work coherently despite non-working elements embraced in their system.

Whenever you come to a word with which you are not familiar, find it in the dictionary and write a sentence which uses that new word. Words are tools—and once you have learned how to use a tool you will never forget it. Just looking for the meaning of the word is not enough. If your vocabulary is comprehensive, you can comprehend both fine and large patterns of experience.

# Shhh…. Inquire

## Walt Whitman

A child said What is the grass? fetching it to me
with full hands, How could I answer the child? I do not know what
it is any more than he ….

## Rainer Maria Rilke

…. the point is to live everything. Live the questions now ….

## Matthew 7:7

Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find;
knock, and it shall be opened to you.

## Thomas Mann
Hold every moment sacred. Give each clarity and meaning, each the weight of thine awareness.

## Heraclitus
You could not find the end of the soul though you traveled everywhere, so deep is its logos.

## Søren Kierkegaard

By possibility I mean a new listening, or as ee cummings would say, “the ears of my ears awake.”
My soul has lost its potentiality. If I were to wish for anything, I should not wish for wealth and power, but for the passionate sense of the potential, for the eye which, ever young and ardent, sees the possible …. what so fragrant, what so intoxicating, as possibility!

## Ortega y Gasset

Did you ever think about the surprising texture of seeking? He who seeks does not have, he does not even know what he seeks, and on the other hand, to seek is to assume the thing sought and indeed to have it by prevision. ##

# Seek ye the kingdom?

## T. S. Eliot

We are coming from where we are going. “Seek ye the Kingdom? It is within.” “Ask and it will be given you.” The question “Who are you?” has “you” already at the heart of it, When I ask “you” who you are and you come with me into the quest, we arc already in partnership, already home in our intention to navigate the question into both known and unknown territory of you, human being. I ask you and you give me yourself. I call to you and your life pours forth. I take you in, no matter what the content of your offerings, your sufferings, your expressions of humanity, of life as you know it, of life as it shows present and absent for you.

With the drawing of this Love
and the voice of
this Calling
We shall not cease from exploration
And the end of all our exploring
 Will be to arrive where we started
 And know the place for the first time,
Through the unknown, remembered gate ….

# Unspoken Word

## Rollo May

…. the pause…. a space yet unfilled…. a “no thing”…. is especially important for the freedom of being …. (it) gives us a whole new world. It is in the pause that people learn to listen to silence.

## T. S. Eliot

If the unheard, unspoken Word is unspoken, unheard;
Still is the unspoken word, the Word unheard,
The Word without a word- the Word within
The world and for the world;
And the light shone in darkness- and
Against the Word the unstilled world still whirled
About the centre of the silent Word.
Where shall the word be found, where will the word
Resound? Not here, there is not enough silence ….

## Chuang Tze

Cease listening with the mind and listen with the vital Spirit…

## Brother David Steindl-Kast

…. the Word, coming forth from Silence, leads …. home into Silence.

## D. H. Lawrence

Only the twilight now. and the -soft “Sh!” of the river That will last for ever.

## ee cummings

being to timelessness as it’s to time, . . . love is the voice under all silences, ….
# The Word

## From the book

Is there anything that we do not have a name and a meaning for? We, human beings, name things and give meanings to everything. If I say anything, any word or a phrase, you are likely to have an association with it, a story for it, an interpretation of it, an opinion about if, an already knowing. Everything means something to us even if our meanings about the same things differ; you and I are very unlikely to listen a word, any word, brand new, putting it no place, doing with it nothing. We will seek to find a history for it, to remember the context we last heard it in. We will even get upset if we have no memory or understanding of what is said, as though we should “know.” We ordinarily listen what we already know, and put things into meanings that we made up long ago, either in our persona] or in our cultural history. Rarely do we not give our experience a ready-made name and meaning; rarely do we simply experience the wonder of human beings speaking, human beings giving expression to their experience of life, human beings making meanings, human beings making words flesh.

Two rather powerful and moving illustrations of what I’m saying, illustrations of the wonder of language, of naming, of being present to the moment of meaning’s birth, come to mind… ………….
A distinguished philosopher of language, Fernando Flores, asserts that listening grants speaking, and that speaking is close to who we arc. Listening grants speaking. Take this in. If you give me your listening, I have a place for my speaking, a partner in bringing forth a world with my words, and so my words become more than vibrations of the air and sound waves, they become worlds, conversations between human beings creating what Martin Buber called “I-Thou,” and ee cummings called “little you-i.” T. S, Eliot said,”, . . . where every word is at home, taking its place to support the others.” I pour myself into your listening. I give you my words, my worlds, my life. You home me. You, through your listening, give me dwelling. You give me residence. You, being, grant me, being.

What are we listening? In, through, between, among the words, what are we attending? To what do I harken and give back to you in my speaking into your listening? What is the dialogue of creation? To what am I listening? When the monastery bell sounds its call to silence, w here must I go to respond to the call? Am I not summoned to listen creation, to attend being, to be present to self? Is “home” in my listening? Is that not the greatest of human gifts? Give me your listening and together we bring forth the world. I give you my listening, and you speak your life. Together we create home. our life, our homecoming to being.
Herein we enter the land of paradox, the land beyond reason, the land from which we build toward the unknown:

# Not knowing

## Lao Tze

Tao is the Tao that can not be spoken …. Listen to it, but you can not hear it! Its name is “Soundless.”

## T. S. Eliot

Not known, because not looked for
But heard, half-heard, in the stillness
Between two waves of the sea.
Quick now, here, now, always—
A condition of complete simplicity
(Costing not less than everything)

## From book

Perhaps we can not say the Truth, but, we can “true” up, that is, we can bring creation home to itself, to its own authentic knowing. In Chinatown in San Francisco there is a bridge along which are tableaus depicting the virtues. One of the virtues is called “The Four Knows”; the tableau depicts the story of one man attempting to bribe another, saying “. . . . and, no one knows,” to which the other says “Whatever do you mean, no one knows? There are four who know: Heaven knows, Earth knows, You know and I know.”
And although we can not speak the Tao, what we can do is promise our humanity as- godly, thereby including the entirety of our human life as creative and recreateable. Perhaps I can listen you as Self, listen you as the unity of your selves. Perhaps we can stand together …

## Heraclitus

It is wise to listen, …. not to me but to the Word, and to confess that all things are one ….

# See into the life of things

## William Wordsworth

While with an eye made quiet by the power
Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,
We see into the life of things.

## Martin Heidegger

… I recall a hand resting on another person, in which there is concentrated a contact that remains infinitely remote from any touch, something that may not even be called gesture any longer in the sense in which 1 understand your usage. For this hand is suffused and borne by a cal calling from afar and calling still farther onward because stillness has brought it.

## Lao Tze

To give life, but to claim nothing.

## William Blake

To see a World in a Grain of Sand
And a Heaven in a Wild flower,
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand,
And Eternity in an hour.

## Nikki Giovanni

…. and if ever i touched a life i hope that life
knows that i know that touching was and still is and
always will be the true revolution

## D. H. Lawrence

now here was I, new-awakened, with my hand stretching out and touching the unknown, the real unknown, the unknown unknown.

# To touchy

## Walt Whitman

It is not possible that we have nothing to contribute to one another. Whatever anyone has given me, that you can have from me. Others have given me their touch, their tenderness, their acknowledgment of my life. I give you my touch, my acknowledgment of your body, of your life. Touch me, touch the palm of your hand to my body as I pass, Be not afraid of my body-

## Walt Whitman

I wish to infuse myself among you till I see it common for you to walk hand in hand.

## Walt Whitman

To touch my person to someone else’s is about as much as I can stand.

## Walt Whitman

All truths wait in all things ….
(What is less or more than a touch?)

## DH Lawrence

Since this is the last night I keep you home.
Come, I will consecrate you for the journey.
# Touching

## from the book

All of the preceding quotes, words on touching, on giving ourselves, our hands to each other, are a perfect setting for one of the main uses of our hands as an acupuncture practitioner, and that is the taking of the pulses. We are instructed by the classics that where blood flows, the Ch’i, the force of life itself, flows. To find a major artery, a place where the blood flows, and then, locate there the Ch’i and feel the flow of life itself, that is known as taking the pulses. It requires what Heidegger referred to as a hand “suffused and borne by a call,” having been brought to its place by “stillness.” There are twelve readings of the Ch’i to locate, each corresponding to an “orb/’ “official/’ “charge.” (See the Postscript on the Three-Heater-) Holding another’s hand with my hand to take her pulses, to “read” her life force, is of great moment. With eyes closed, silence in the room, and fingers over the radial arterial blood pulse, I attend. So does my patient. We listen together, present to the life of her life. My hands are the bodily bridge between us, as later the needle will be when it enters the point of choice to give witness, to create connection, to clear the way.

## Jacques Lusseyran, blind from the age of eight, wrote of touching:

Touching the tomatoes in the garden, and really touching them, touching the walls of the house, the materials of the curtains or a clod of earth is surely seeing them as fully as eyes can see. But it is more than seeing them, it is tuning in on them and allowing the current they hold to connect with one’s own, like electricity. To put it differently, this means an end of living in front of things and a beginning of living with them. Never mind if the word sounds shocking, for this is love. You cannot keep your hands from loving what they have really felt ….

# Prayer St. Francis

“Camerado, I give you my hand!” Our work is to bear each other home, to take care of each other. I personally can think of nothing more wonderful than to be the handmaiden of life, to serve as an instrument of peace on my way home, no matter how many times in a day I may forget to reach out my hand. This work reminds me of my stewardship. In concluding this chapter I give you one of my favorite passages, which speaks of this chapter’s theme:

## Francis’ Prayer

Lord, make me an instrument of your peace,
Where there is hatred, let me sow love;
Where there is injury, pardon;
Where there is doubt, faith;
Where there is despair, hope;
Where there is darkness, light;
Where there is sadness, joy.
O Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek To be consoled as to console
To he understood as to understand To be loved as to love.
For, it is in giving that we receive.
It in in pardoning that we are pardoned.
and it is in dying that we are born to Eternal Life.

–Prayer of St. Francis of Assisi

## Teilhard de Chardin, in Hymn of the Universe
