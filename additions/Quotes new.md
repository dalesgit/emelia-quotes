# In the present moment

Hurry is an unpleasant thing in itself, but also very unpleasant for whoever is around it. Some people came into my room and rushed in and rushed out and even when they were there they were not there - they were in the moment ahead or the moment behind. Some people who came in just for a moment were all there, completely in that moment.

Live from day to day, just from day to day. If you do so, you worry less and live more richly. If you let yourself be absorbed completely, if you surrender completely to the moments as they pass, you live more richly those moments.

*Anne Morrow Lindbergh*

# A child's cry

Once you've heard a child cry out to heaven for help, and go unanswered,
nothing's ever the same again.
Nothing.
Even God changes.

But there is a healing hand at work that cannot be deflected from its purpose.
I just can't make sense of it, other than to cry.
Those tears are part of what it is to be a monk.
Out there, in the world, it can be very cold.

It seems to be about luck, good and bad, and the distribution is absurd.
We have to be candles, burning between hope and despair, faith and doubt, life and death, all the opposites.

*William Broderick*

Give me a candle of the Spirit, O God, as I go down into the deeps of my being. Show me the hidden things, the creatures of my dreams, the storehouse of forgotten memories and hurts. Take me down to the spring of my life, and tell me my nature and my name. Give me freedom to grow, so that l may become that self, the seed of which You planted in me at my making.

Out of the depths I cry to You...

*George Appleton*

#  Be generous to yourself

You need to be generous to yourself in order to receive the love that surrounds you.
You can suffer from a desperate hunger to be loved.
You can search long years in lonely places, far outside yourself.
Yet the whole time, this love is but a few inches away from you.
It is at the edge of your soul, but you have been blind to its presence.
We must remain attentive in order to be able to receive.

*John O'Donohue*

When a great moment knocks on the door of your life, it is often no louder than the beating of your heart, and it is very easy to miss it.

*Boris Pasternak*


# Simple joys are holy

If you want your dream to be 
Take your time, go slowly
Do few things but do them well
Heartfelt work grows purely
If you want to live life free 
Take your time, go slowly
Do few things but do them well

Heartfelt work grows purely
Day by day, stone by stone 
Build your secret slowly 
Day by day, you'll grow too 
You'll know heaven's glory

If you want to live life free 
Take your time, go slowly 
If you want your dream to be 
Take your time, go slowly

“**Little church**" (*Donovan Leitch*)

# Have patience with yourself

Have patience with everything unresolved in your heart, 
and try to love the questions themselves 
as if they were locked rooms
or books written in a very foreign language.

Do not search for the answers, which could not be given to you now,
because you would not be able to live them.
And the point is to live everything.
Live the questions now.
Perhaps then, someday far in the future, you will gradually,
without even noticing it, live your way into the answer.

*Rainer Maria Rilke*

Be open to the night...
Pray with open hand, not with clenched fist...
Shapes loom out of the darkness, uncertain and unclear: but the hooded stranger on horseback emerging from the mist need not be assumed to be the bearer of ill...
The night is large and full of wonders...

*Lord Dunsany*

# In all things

What God may hereafter require of you, you must not give yourself the least trouble about.
Everything He gives you to do, you must do as well as ever you can.
That is the best possible preparation for what He may want you to do next.
If people would but do what they have to do, they would always find themselves ready for what came next.

*George MacDonald*

I will not die an unlived life, I will not live in fear of falling or catching fire.
I choose to inhabit my days, to allow my living to open me, to make me less afraid, more accessible, to loosen my heart until it becomes a wing, a torch, a promise...

*Dawna Markova*

## If you must

If you must be heard, let it be like the babbling brook, laughing over the rocks.
If you must be seen, let it be like sunlight giving warmth and comfort to all.
If you must be acknowledged, let it be as the eyes behold the skies in all their glory.
If you must lead, let it be like the wind and all its unshackled direction.
If you must learn, let it be like breathing, the natural flow of in and out, and done without thinking.
If you must teach, let it be like the water, deep and flowing,
for your words are like pebbles in a pond, the ripples they cause spread out in all directions, and what you give out eventually returns.
If you must know, let it be flowing and growing.
And above all, if you must: shine!

*Kerry Hillcoat*

# Listen to your life

Listen to your life.
See it for the fathomless mystery that it is.
In the boredom and pain of it no less than in the excitement and gladness:
touch, taste, smell your way to the holy and hidden heart of it because in the last analysis all moments are key moments, and life itself is grace.

*Frederick Buechner*


# God the artist

Thou takest the pen - and the lines dance.\\
Thou takest the flute - and the notes shimmer.\\
Thou takest the brush - and the colours sing.\\
So all things have meaning and beauty in that\\ space beyond time where Thou art.\\
How, then, can I hold back anything from Thee?

*Dag Hammarskjöld*

## Trust 

My Lord God,
I have no idea where I am going.
I do not see the road ahead of me.
I cannot know for certain where it will end.
Nor do I really know myself,
and the fact that I think that I am following Your will does not mean that I am actually doing so.

But I believe that the desire to please You does in fact please You.
And I hope that I have that desire in all that I am doing.

And I know that if I do this, You will lead me by the right road although I may know nothing about it.
Therefore will I trust You always, though I may seem to be lost and in the shadow of death,
I will not fear, for You are ever with me, and will never leave me to face my perils alone.

*Thomas Merton*

# Wild ones

As the tamed horse\\
still hears the call of her wild brothers\\
and as the farmed goose flaps hopeful wings\\
as his sisters fly overhead,\\
so too, perhaps,\\
the wild ones amongst us\\
are our only hope in calling us back to our true nature.

Wild ones who have not been turned to stone by the far-reaching grasp of the empire and its programme of consumer sedation, the killing of imagination.

Where, my friends, have the wild ones gone?

*Joel McKerrow*


'Come to the edge', He said. They said,\\
'We are afraid'.\\
'Come to the edge', He said. They came.\\
He pushed them, and they flew.

*Guillaume Apollinaire*

# Long enough to learn

Our lives are long enough to learn what we need to learn, but not long enough to change anything. 

That is our flaw. Each age must learn everything afresh. Such waste!

Such waste - making all the mistakes once and again, each generation making the same mistakes, fumbling in ignorance and darkness.

This oak was already old when I was born.
Now I am old and soon to die, and this tree grows strong still.

We are small creatures.
Our lives are not long, but long enough to learn.

*Stephen Lawhead*
