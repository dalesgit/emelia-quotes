## T. S. Eliot

We are coming from where we are going. “Seek ye the Kingdom? It is within.” “Ask and it will be given you.” The question “Who are you?” has “you” already at the heart of it, When I ask “you” who you are and you come with me into the quest, we arc already in partnership, already home in our intention to navigate the question into both known and unknown territory of you, human being. I ask you and you give me yourself. I call to you and your life pours forth. I take you in, no matter what the content of your offerings, your sufferings, your expressions of humanity, of life as you know it, of life as it shows present and absent for you.

With the drawing of this Love\\
and the voice of\\
this Calling\\
We shall not cease from exploration\\
And the end of all our exploring\\
 Will be to arrive where we started\\
 And know the place for the first time,\\
Through the unknown, remembered gate ….
