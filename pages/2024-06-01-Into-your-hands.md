## Prayer of Abandonment

Father, I abandon myself into Your hands.  Do with me what You will, whatever You do, I will thank You, I am ready for all, I accept all.  Let only Your will be done in me, as in all Your creatures, and Iâ€™ll ask nothing else, my Lord.  Into Your hands I commend my spirit; I give it to You with all the love of my heart, for I love You, Lord, and so need to give myself, to surrender myself into Your hands with a trust beyond all measure, because You are my Father.

*Charles de Foucauld*

## Covenant prayer

*THE METHODIST COVENANT PRAYER*

I am no longer my own, but Thine.  Put me to what Thou wilt, rank me with whom Thou wilt; put me to doing, put me to suffering; let me be employed for Thee or laid aside for Thee; let me be exalted for Thee, or brought low for Thee; let me be full, let me be empty; let me have all things, let me have nothing; I freely and heartily yield all things to Thy pleasure and disposal.  And now, O glorious and blessed God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, Thou art mine, and I am Thine.  So be it.  And the covenant which I have made on earth, let it be ratified in heaven.  Amen.
