title: Have patience with yourself

Have patience with everything unresolved in your heart, \\
and try to love the questions themselves \\
as if they were locked rooms\\
or books written in a very foreign language.

Do not search for the answers, which could not be given to you now,\\
because you would not be able to live them.\\
And the point is to live everything.\\
Live the questions now.\\
Perhaps then, someday far in the future, you will gradually,\\
without even noticing it, live your way into the answer.

*Rainer Maria Rilke*

Be open to the night...\\
Pray with open hand, not with clenched fist...\\
Shapes loom out of the darkness, uncertain and unclear: but the hooded stranger on horseback emerging from the mist need not be assumed to be the bearer of ill...\\
The night is large and full of wonders...

*Lord Dunsany*
