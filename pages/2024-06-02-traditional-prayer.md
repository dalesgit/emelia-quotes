As the rain hides the stars,\\
as the autumn mist hides the hills,\\
happenings of my lot\\
hide the shining of Thy face from me.\\
Yet, if I may hold Thy hand\\
in the darkness,\\
it is enough;\\
since I know that,\\
though I may stumble in my going,\\
Thou dost not fall.\\

*Alistair Maclean*

The Lord is thy keeper,\\
the Lord is thy shade.\\
The sun shall not smite thee by day,\\
nor the moon by night.\\
The Lord shall preserve thee,\\
thy soul from all evil;\\
the Lord shall preserve thee,\\
thy going and thy coming,\\
from this time forward,\\
and even for evermore.

## from Psalm 121

As it was, as it is,\\
and as it shall be\\
evermore, God of grace,\\
God in Trinity!\\
With the ebb, with the flow,\\
ever it is so,\\
God of grace, O Trinity,\\
with the ebb and flow.

Traditional Gaelic prayer learned from
*Alexander Macneill*, fishsalter, **Barra**
