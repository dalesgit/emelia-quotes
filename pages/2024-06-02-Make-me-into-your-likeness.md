## Master’s face

No pictured likeness of my Lord\\
I have;\\
He carved no record\\
of His ministry\\
on wood or stone,\\
He left no sculptured tomb\\
nor parchment dim\\
but trusted for all memory of Him\\
the heart alone.\\
Who sees the face but sees in part;\\
Who reads the spirit which it hides,\\
sees all;\\
he needs no more.\\
Thy life in my life, Lord,\\
give Thou to me;\\
and then, in truth,\\
I may forever see\\
my Master’s face!

(*William Hurd Hillyer*)

## Arise my love

Arise, my love, my fair one,\\
and come away with me.\\
Arise, my love, my fair one,\\
and come away with me.\\
For lo, the winter is passed\\
and the rain is gone away.\\
Come away with me,\\
come away with me.\\
The flowers appear on the earth,\\
the time for singing has come,\\
and the voice of the turtle-dove\\
is heard in our land.\\
Come away with me.\\
The fig-tree puts forth its fruit,\\
the vines are in blossom,\\
they put forth their fragrance,\\
O come away with me.\\
Arise, my love, my fair one,\\
come away with me.\\
Arise, my love, my fair one,\\
come away with me.\\
O come away with me,\\
come away\\
with me.

(*John and Ross Harding*)

## Lady Poverty

*LADY POVERTY IN THE EYES OF JUNIPER, FRIEND OF FRANCIS, FOOL OF GOD*

If I am truly poor, then I am dependent on others for everything, and I feel useless and worthless, and I realize deep within that everything is a gift from the Father. Then in this attitude of complete dependence, I become useful again, for then I am empty of selfishness and I am free to be God’s instrument instead of my own. In poverty I begin to value everything rightly again. I see how little really matters, and I see that only that which glorifies God is of value.

I write these words in pain, Lady Poverty, for I have wept bitter tears because I was poor and had to beg from others, and I felt like a burden to people and to God … And I have grown weary of Christ’s words not to worry about tomorrow. But in His grace I have surrendered to God’s sovereignty and providence, and it has made me free …

Lady Poverty, I love you. You, my Lady, take all the sting from being poor. In your embrace I am rich indeed, for I have someone to love. I have you. Perhaps, my Lady, that is why I keep submitting, surrendering my desire to control my life, my need to provide for the future. You have stolen my heart and made me happy, and your love makes up for all the pain that loving you involves … and we know it is all worthwhile because when we look into your eyes, we see Christ Himself.

(*Murray Bodo*)
