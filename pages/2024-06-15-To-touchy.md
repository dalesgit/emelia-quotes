## Walt Whitman

It is not possible that we have nothing to contribute to one another. Whatever anyone has given me, that you can have from me. Others have given me their touch, their tenderness, their acknowledgment of my life. I give you my touch, my acknowledgment of your body, of your life. Touch me, touch the palm of your hand to my body as I pass, Be not afraid of my body-

## Walt Whitman

I wish to infuse myself among you till I see it common for you to walk hand in hand.

## Walt Whitman

To touch my person to someone else’s is about as much as I can stand.

## Walt Whitman

All truths wait in all things ….
(What is less or more than a touch?)

## DH Lawrence

Since this is the last night I keep you home.\\
Come, I will consecrate you for the journey.
