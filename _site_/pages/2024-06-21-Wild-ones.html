<h1 id="wild-ones">Wild ones</h1>

<p>As the tamed horse<br />
still hears the call of her wild brothers<br />
and as the farmed goose flaps hopeful wings<br />
as his sisters fly overhead,<br />
so too, perhaps,<br />
the wild ones amongst us<br />
are our only hope in calling us back to our true nature.</p>

<p>Wild ones who have not been turned to stone by the far-reaching grasp of the empire and its programme of consumer sedation, the killing of imagination.</p>

<p>Where, my friends, have the wild ones gone?</p>

<p><em>Joel McKerrow</em></p>

<p>‘Come to the edge’, He said. They said,<br />
‘We are afraid’.<br />
‘Come to the edge’, He said. They came.<br />
He pushed them, and they flew.</p>

<p>*Guillaume Apollinaire</p>
