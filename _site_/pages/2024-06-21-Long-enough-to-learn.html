<h1 id="long-enough-to-learn">Long enough to learn</h1>

<p>Our lives are long enough to learn what we need to learn, but not long enough to change anything.</p>

<p>That is our flaw. Each age must learn everything afresh. Such waste!</p>

<p>Such waste - making all the mistakes once and again, each generation making the same mistakes, fumbling in ignorance and darkness.</p>

<p>This oak was already old when I was born.
Now I am old and soon to die, and this tree grows strong still.</p>

<p>We are small creatures.
Our lives are not long, but long enough to learn.</p>

<p>*Stephen Lawhead</p>
