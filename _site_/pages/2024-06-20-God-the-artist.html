<h1 id="god-the-artist">God the artist</h1>

<p>Thou takest the pen - and the lines dance.<br />
Thou takest the flute - and the notes shimmer.<br />
Thou takest the brush - and the colours sing.<br />
So all things have meaning and beauty in that\ space beyond time where Thou art.<br />
How, then, can I hold back anything from Thee?</p>

<h2 id="trust">Trust</h2>

<p>My Lord God,
I have no idea where I am going.
I do not see the road ahead of me.
I cannot know for certain where it will end.
Nor do I really know myself,
and the fact that I think that I am following Your will does not mean that I am actually doing so.</p>

<p>But I believe that the desire to please You does in fact please You.
And I hope that I have that desire in all that I am doing.</p>

<p>And I know that if I do this, You will lead me by the right road although I may know nothing about it.
Therefore will I trust You always, though I may seem to be lost and in the shadow of death,
I will not fear, for You are ever with me, and will never leave me to face my perils alone.</p>

<p><em>Thomas Merton</em></p>
