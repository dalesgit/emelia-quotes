## Rollo May

…. the pause…. a space yet unfilled…. a “no thing”…. is especially important for the freedom of being …. (it) gives us a whole new world. It is in the pause that people learn to listen to silence.

## T. S. Eliot

If the unheard, unspoken Word is unspoken, unheard;\\
Still is the unspoken word, the Word unheard,\\
The Word without a word- the Word within\\
The world and for the world;\\
And the light shone in darkness- and\\
Against the Word the unstilled world still whirled\\
About the centre of the silent Word.\\
Where shall the word be found, where will the word\\
Resound? Not here, there is not enough silence ….

## Chuang Tze

Cease listening with the mind and listen with the vital Spirit…

## Brother David Steindl-Kast

…. the Word, coming forth from Silence, leads …. home into Silence.

## D. H. Lawrence

Only the twilight now. and the -soft “Sh!” of the river That will last for ever.

## ee cummings

being to timelessness as it’s to time, . . . love is the voice under all silences, ….
