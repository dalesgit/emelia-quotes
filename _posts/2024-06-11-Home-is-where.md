## T. S. Eliot

Home is where we start from . . .

## Robert Frost

“Warren,” she said, “he has come home to die:\\
You needn’t be afraid he’ll leave you this time.”\\
“Home,” he mocked gently.\\
“Yes, what else but home?\\
It all depends on what you mean by home.\\
Of course, he’s nothing to us, any more\\
Than was the hound that came as a stranger to us\\
Out of the woods, worn out upon the trail.\\
“Home is the place where, when you have to go there,\\
They have to take you in.”
