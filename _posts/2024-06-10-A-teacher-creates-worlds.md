## Benjamin Hoff, The Tao of Pooh

A teacher creates worlds. Each world created is a sacred vessel. As Roethke defines the word, “Teacher: one who carries on her education in public.” She creates by giving voice and giving silence, by speaking words and listening from whence the words come. She can not be teacher-coach-awe-inspirer without giving herself away, without opening to her own astonishing aliveness, without publicly wondering and wandering in her own beginner’s mind.

“Don’t say; create.” These words from Roethke express the promise of one’s life as teacher. Life is awesome, awe-filled. She teaches from awe, and not from her opinions, beliefs, advice. She does whatever will forward the life of the one or ones she is coaching. “Teach as an old fishing guide takes out a beginner.” (Roethke) She lives at the edge of life as a creative act, continuous and evolving, not infrequently terrified of her own godliness; not infrequently enraptured by the joy and fun of it all; always grappling with her own humanity. “When you discard arrogance, complexity, and a few other things that get in the way, sooner or later you will discover that simple, childlike, and mysterious secret known to those of the Uncarved Block: Life is Fun.”
