What God may hereafter require of you, you must not give yourself the least trouble about.
Everything He gives you to do, you must do as well as ever you can.
That is the best possible preparation for what He may want you to do next.
If people would but do what they have to do, they would always find themselves ready for what came next.

*George MacDonald*

I will not die an unlived life, I will not live in fear of falling or catching fire.
I choose to inhabit my days, to allow my living to open me, to make me less afraid, more accessible, to loosen my heart until it becomes a wing, a torch, a promise...

*Dawna Markova*
